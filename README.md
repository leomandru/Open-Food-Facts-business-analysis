# Open-Food-Facts-business-analysis
The OFF_report.pdf paper describes the design process of a multidimensional model for analyzing data coming from the Open Food Facts platform. It aims to find an efficient solution to support Online Analytical Processes (OLAP). We can divide the followed approach into three main steps. Firstly, a design phase (sections 1 and 2) — i.e., UML modeling and ER schema design. Secondly, an implementation stage (sections 2 and 3) — i.e., SQL code to physically implement the ER schema and Kettle transformations to populate it. Finally, a querying process followed by some analysis (sections 4 and 5) — i.e., MDX queries design and discussion of the results obtained.
